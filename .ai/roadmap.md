# Roadmap — withheld (game) — v0.1 → v1.0
<!-- bloch:roadmap schema=1 kind=game lane=restricted baseline=0.1.0 target=1.0.0 -->

How to work this roadmap (any agent): run `bloch task start R-xxx --agent <you>` before working a task, `bloch task done R-xxx` when you believe it is complete — done runs every `verify:` command and flips the task green only if all pass; there is no override. `bloch task fail R-xxx --error "..."` records a failure. Fixes learned the hard way land in `.ai/memory/lessons.md` via the inbox/promote flow and are surfaced in every HANDOFF.
